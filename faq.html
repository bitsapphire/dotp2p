						<p>1The combination of price discovery via an auction and opportunity cost of purchasing a domain (lost dividends from equivalent value of domainshares) makes it more profitable to hold DNS than to hold domains speculatively. This is the only source of revenue for the network, aside from standard per-byte transaction fees.</p>
						<p>Domains are sold in a process similar to an auction. You are incentivized to bid the highest you are willing pay for a name. The higher you bid it up from what you *have* to pay (starting at 0), the more the bidder *directly after* you has to pay.</p>
						<p>If you get the name, great! You paid what you said you were willing. But here's the fun part: If you don't, you get back not only your original bid, but a fixed percentage as compensation for participating!</p>
						<p>Here are the two examples to understand. Note the unit of account is a "bip", or one billionth of the current share supply. Here "p" is some fixed ratio (say, 10%).</p>
						<p>You claim to value example.p2p at no more than 100 bips, so you put down a bid for 100 (these all go to shareholders). The next person has to bid at least 200. Nobody else bids, you win the name.</p>
						<p>You claim to value example.p2p at no more than 100 bips, so you put down a bid for 100 (these all go to shareholders). The next person has to bid at least 200. Suppose they bid 250. Then you get (p * (250-100)), the shareholders recieve ((1-p) * (250-100)), and the next person has to bid at least ((250 - 200) + 250) = 300. You can see how you would be discouraged from participating is small bidding wars (for example, bidding 301 as the next participant), and always the best option is "pay what you think is fair or leave with your profit".</p>
